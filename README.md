# Language-Translation
Personal Project
Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need:

Python (>= 3.6)
TensorFlow (>= 2.0)
NumPy

Usage
Data Preparation: Prepare your training data. Ensure that you have parallel data, meaning pairs of sentences in both the source and target languages. This data will be used to train the model.

Model Training: Train the Encoder-Decoder model using your prepared data. The training script is provided in the repository. You may need to adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs according to your specific dataset and requirements.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate validation set to assess its performance. You can measure metrics such as BLEU score, which is commonly used for evaluating machine translation models.

Inference: Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, you can use it for language conversion. Provide a sentence in the source language as input to the model, and it will output the corresponding translated sentence in the target language.

Feel free to contribute to this repository by submitting pull requests or opening issues for suggestions and bug reports. Happy coding!
